    /*  O(n)
        Approach:
            We will first push all are elements in the HashSet.
            Then we will run a for loop and check for any number(x) if it is the starting number
            of the consecutive sequence by checking if the HashSet contains (x-1) or not.
            If ‘x’ is the starting number of the consecutive sequence we will keep searching
            for the numbers y = x+1, x+2, x+3, ….. And stop at the first ‘y’ which is not
            present in the HashSet. Using this we can calculate the length of the longest
            consecutive subsequence.
